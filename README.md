DHT11 + DS18B20 temperature sensor + LDR + soil humidity sensor with Arduino 

In order to connect them together with the arduino, all you need to do is change the differents pins.

I put every sensor code alone and then combined them in the file Temperature-and-humidity-sensors-with-Arduino.


The images explain how to connect the different sensors with the arduino.

This is how to connect the soil humidity sensor

    Sensor --> Arduino Uno
    
    Vcc --> +5V Arduino
    
    GND -->  GND Arduino
    
    A0 (ANALOG) --> pin A0 Arduino
    
    D0 (DIGITAL) --> pin 3 digital Arduino
